## P0 — Launch Blockers

Nothing ships without these.

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | ⬜ | Bug | **Stripe webhook rawBody bug** — `JSON.stringify(request.body)` used for signature verification instead of raw bytes. All plan changes (upgrade, downgrade, cancel) silently fail with 400. | `webhooks.ts:227` | Register `@fastify/rawbody`. Use `request.rawBody` in both Stripe and Clerk webhook handlers. Test before setting live Stripe keys. |
| P0-2 | ⬜ | Config | **Stripe billing not activated** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and 4 price IDs (`STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER/GROWTH/SCALE/AGENCY`) not set. No revenue possible. | Render env vars | Fix P0-1 first, then set keys and test end-to-end checkout → webhook → plan update. |
| P0-3 | ⬜ | Feature | **No email lead storage** — Popup form submissions fire an `email_capture` event but no lead data is persisted in a retrievable format. No dashboard UI exists to view submissions. This is the core use case for most popup operators. Will cause immediate churn. | `schema.ts` (no leads table) | Create `leads` table (tenantId, campaignId, email, name, metadata, createdAt). API endpoint to list/export. Dashboard UI. |
| P0-4 | ⬜ | Bug | **A/B testing passthrough deceives users** — The campaign design editor shows a live percentage slider. The `ab_test` targeting kind in the snippet is `return true` (passthrough). Users who discover this will request refunds. | `packages/snippet/src/main.ts` | Either implement real A/B allocation or remove the slider and label Experiments as "coming soon". |
| P0-5 | ⬜ | Bug | **Campaign activate/pause does not bust KV cache** — Two TODO comments in code confirm this is unfinished. Pausing a campaign leaves it live for up to 60 seconds. Activating a campaign may not propagate. | `campaigns.ts:281`, `campaigns.ts:313` | Call `DELETE /api/v1/internal/cache/:publicKey` for the site's public key on every activate/pause/status change. |

## P1 — High Priority

Core product gaps vs. Promolayer and high-severity technical issues.

### Security

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | ⬜ | Security | **Cross-tenant event injection** — The `/e` ingest endpoint resolves `campaignId` without scoping to the requesting tenant. Any authenticated or unauthenticated caller who knows a campaign UUID can inject click/dismiss/conversion events into another tenant's analytics. | `index.ts:474` | Validate that inbound `campaignId` belongs to a site whose public key is in the request context, or require the public key in the event payload and verify it server-side. |
| P1-2 | ⬜ | Security | **Stripe checkout open redirect** — `successUrl` and `cancelUrl` accept any valid URL. Attacker can craft a Stripe checkout link that redirects victims to a phishing site after payment. | `billing.ts:63` | Validate `successUrl` and `cancelUrl` against an allowlist of known dashboard origins before passing to Stripe. |
| P1-3 | ⬜ | Security | **Distributed bot view quota exhaustion** — A botnet with 100+ IPs (each under the 120 imp/min gate) can exhaust a free tenant's 1,000 monthly views in seconds, disabling their popups for the month. | `index.ts:480` | Validate that the impression's `pageUrl` origin matches the site's registered domain before counting against the quota. Reject impressions from unknown origins. |

### Performance

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-4 | ⬜ | Performance | **N+1 in production config route** — For each active campaign, 4 separate DB calls are issued (design, triggers, targeting, frequency). A site with 10 campaigns = 40 DB round trips per KV miss. The local dev route already has the correct batched pattern using `inArray`. | `internal.ts:114–163` | Replace per-campaign queries with 4 batched `inArray` queries grouped by `campaignId`, identical to the fix already in `index.ts` local `/c/` route. |
| P1-5 | ⬜ | Performance | **No connection pool size limit on Neon client** — Default `postgres()` settings. Under concurrent load, connections to Neon's pooler can exceed plan limits causing 500s across all API routes. | `db/client.ts` | Set `max: 10` (or appropriate for Neon plan) on the `postgres()` client. Monitor connection count in Neon console. |
| P1-6 | ⬜ | Performance | **`campaignMetaCache` thundering herd** — When cache hits 5,000 entries all are evicted simultaneously. Every concurrent request then hits the DB. | `index.ts:416` | Replace with an LRU with individual entry TTLs. Or move campaign meta lookups to a Redis hash with per-key TTL. |

### Features vs. Promolayer

| # | Status | Category | Item | Promolayer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-7 | ⬜ | Feature | **Email lead capture UI** — No dashboard page to view, search, or export captured email leads. Even after P0-3 (storage) is built, users need a UI to access their leads. | ✅ contact database in dashboard | Leads page: list view, search by email/campaign, CSV export, mark read. |
| P1-8 | ⬜ | Feature | **Klaviyo integration** — No way to push captured emails to Klaviyo. This is the most-requested integration for Shopify operators. | ✅ native | Webhook on `email_capture` event → POST to Klaviyo List API with operator's API key stored in tenant settings. |
| P1-9 | ⬜ | Feature | **Mailchimp integration** | ✅ native | Same pattern as Klaviyo — operator pastes API key + list ID in Settings → Integrations. |
| P1-10 | ⬜ | Feature | **Real A/B testing** — Proper variant allocation (weighted random assignment per visitor, sticky via localStorage), win condition detection, statistical significance indicator. | ✅ full A/B/N + control groups | Must be lazy-loaded or snippet exceeds 10 KB gate. Design as a separate module. |
| P1-11 | ⬜ | Feature | **Countdown timers** — Present in every popup competitor. Standard FOMO/urgency tool. Absent from all ScrollPop popup types. | ✅ native | Add `countdown` element type to the block builder. Snippet renderer handles `Date.now()` countdown display. |
| P1-12 | ⬜ | Feature | **Gamified popups (spin-to-win)** — Removed Jun 3 2026 because the editor had no entry point. Promolayer claims 300% more submissions vs standard. | ✅ claims 3× conversion | Must be lazy-loaded (separate JS chunk, fetched only when a gamified campaign renders) to protect the 10 KB gate. Build editor entry point + snippet lazy-loader together. |
| P1-13 | ⬜ | Feature | **Shopify App Embed Block** — Current Shopify integration uses Script Tag. App Embed Block is the modern approach: no theme code edits, faster, required for App Store approval. | ✅ (implied by listing) | Required before Shopify App Store submission. |
| P1-14 | ⬜ | Feature | **Shopify App Store submission** — 4.9★ Promolayer listing with 61 reviews is an inbound discovery channel ScrollPop has no equivalent of. All Shopify operators find tools via the App Store. | ✅ 4.9★ 61 reviews | Requires App Embed Block (P1-13) first. |
| P1-15 | ⬜ | UX | **New user onboarding** — A new user lands on a blank Dashboard with empty KPI tiles and no prompt. No guided onboarding, no empty-state CTAs, no setup checklist. | ✅ implied by 25K sites | Add empty state to Dashboard: "Add your first site →", "Create your first campaign →". Consider a setup checklist widget. |
| P1-16 | ⬜ | UX | **Billing upgrade throws 500** — `POST /billing/checkout` requires `STRIPE_PRICE_*` env vars not yet set. Any user clicking upgrade sees a server error. | `billing.ts:54–60` | Blocked by P0-2. Once Stripe is configured this resolves automatically, but add a graceful "Billing not yet available" state for pre-launch. |
| P1-17 | ⬜ | Security | **Incomplete ReDoS protection in url_regex** — `isSafeRegex()` catches simple nested quantifier patterns but not alternation-based ReDoS (e.g. `([a-zA-Z]+)*`). A malicious operator can cause snippet to hang in visitor browsers. | `sanitize.ts:93` | Replace with a battle-tested ReDoS-safe validator (`safe-regex2` or equivalent). Add it as a zero-dep vendored check or run the regex with a `performance.now()` wall-clock timeout. |
| P1-18 | ⬜ | Debt | **No API route integration tests** — Zero tests for route-level behaviour, tenant isolation (IDOR scenarios), or webhook signature verification paths. The sanitizer and E2E suites cover the ends but nothing in between. | `apps/api` | Add Vitest integration tests for: tenant isolation on campaigns/sites/analytics, event injection rejection, webhook 400 on bad signature, billing checkout validation. |

---

## P2 — Medium Priority

Real issues, not blocking launch, should be addressed in the first growth sprint.

### Security

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | ⬜ | Security | **No CSP header on API responses** | `index.ts:104` | Add `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` — API serves only JSON, so this is safe and adds defence in depth. |
| P2-2 | ⬜ | Security | **Internal secret IP spoofing** — If `INTERNAL_SECRET` is ever leaked, an attacker can set `X-CF-Connecting-IP` to any value and bypass per-IP rate limits. | `index.ts:397` | Add rate of change monitoring on INTERNAL_SECRET usage; document rotation procedure clearly in MASTER.md. Rotate quarterly. |
| P2-3 | ⬜ | Security | **Client-controlled country field in event payload** — Direct POST to `/e` (not via Worker) accepts any `country` value, skewing geo analytics. | `index.ts:495` | Only trust the `country` field when the request arrives from the Worker (proven by INTERNAL_SECRET). Otherwise set `country: null` and rely on the Worker's `CF-IPCountry` enrichment. |
| P2-4 | ⬜ | Security | **No audit log for admin operations** — Plan changes, tenant deletions, and sync operations leave no persistent record. | `admin.ts` | Write an `admin_audit_log` table row on every admin action: `who`, `action`, `target_tenant_id`, `before`, `after`, `ts`. |
| P2-5 | ⬜ | Security | **Shopify access tokens stored in plaintext** | `schema.ts:183` | Encrypt at rest using AES-256-GCM with `token-crypto.ts` (already exists in the codebase). Decrypt on use. |
| P2-6 | ⬜ | Security | **Admin sync limited to 500 Clerk users** — Stale/deleted users past the 500-user limit will not be cleaned up. | `admin.ts:178` | Paginate using Clerk's offset/cursor: loop until `clerkResponse.data.length < limit`. |

### Performance

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-7 | ⬜ | Performance | **No `tenantId` index within TimescaleDB partitions** — Analytics queries do full-chunk scans within each partition. Will degrade with tenant count. | `analytics.ts` | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON events(tenant_id, ts DESC)` on the Neon production DB. |
| P2-8 | ⬜ | Performance | **Admin tenant list N+1** — Two additional DB queries per tenant row to fetch owner email. | `admin.ts:95` | Rewrite with a single JOIN: `SELECT t.*, u.email, u.name FROM tenants t JOIN tenant_members tm ON ... JOIN users u ON ...`. |
| P2-9 | ⬜ | Performance | **In-process purge-deleted.ts causes latency spikes** — Hourly in-process job runs async DB deletes on the same pod serving API requests. | `db/purge-deleted.ts` | Move to a separate Render Cron Job (free tier) or a pg_cron job in Neon. Decouples cleanup from request serving. |
| P2-10 | ⬜ | Performance | **Campaign export 100K rows in-memory** — No streaming. A large export holds a DB connection and loads everything into memory before responding. | `campaigns.ts:236` | Stream the response using a cursor-paginated query and Node.js `Readable` piped to the reply. |
| P2-11 | ⬜ | Performance | **No query timeouts on Drizzle queries** — A slow analytics query can hold a connection indefinitely. | `db/client.ts` | Set `statement_timeout` on the postgres client: `postgres(url, { connection: { statement_timeout: 30000 } })`. |

### Features vs. Promolayer

| # | Status | Category | Item | Promolayer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-12 | ⬜ | Feature | **Coupon code auto-generation** — Field exists in schema but there is no auto-generation or validation flow. | ✅ auto-generation | Generate unique coupon codes per campaign. Store in a `coupons` table. Validate redemption on the `/e` ingest path via `discount_redeemed` event. |
| P2-13 | ⬜ | Feature | **Email auto-responders** — No way to send a follow-up email after a visitor submits a form. | ✅ paid plans | On `email_capture` event, optionally send a configured reply via Resend. Operator configures subject/body in campaign settings. |
| P2-14 | ⬜ | Feature | **Zapier integration** — No outbound webhook on events. | ✅ native | Add a webhook configuration to campaign settings. On qualifying events (`email_capture`, `conversion`), POST to the operator's webhook URL. This also covers the general "Webhook outbound" v2 roadmap item. |
| P2-15 | ⬜ | UX | **Journeys and Experiments pages appear broken** — Both show placeholder content with no "coming soon" framing. They are URL-reachable and make the product look unfinished. | N/A | Add explicit "Coming soon" empty states with expected availability. Or gate behind feature flags so they don't appear in nav until ready. |
| P2-16 | ⬜ | UX | **Agency multi-tenant: all Novatise emails share one tenant** — No way to segregate data per client within the shared org. | N/A | Long-term: Clerk Organizations with per-client workspaces. Short-term: document the limitation in the agency onboarding. |
| P2-17 | ⬜ | Feature | **Team invitations UI** — Clerk org invitations exist but there is no dashboard wrapper. Settings page has no invite flow. | ❓ | Wrap Clerk's `inviteToOrganization` in a Settings → Team section: enter email, select role, send. List pending invitations. |
| P2-18 | ⬜ | Infra | **`api.scrollpop.online` custom domain** — API still served from `scroll-pop.onrender.com`. All internal references use the Render URL. | N/A | Add Cloudflare DNS CNAME → Render. Update `API_BASE_URL`, `SNIPPET_EDGE_URL` references. Cleaner and removes Render vendor lock-in from URLs. |
| P2-19 | ⬜ | Security | **No rate limit on admin routes** | `admin.ts` | Add a dedicated lower rate limit (e.g. 20 req/min) on all `/api/v1/admin/*` routes. |

## P3 — Low Priority

Real issues but low urgency. Address during maintenance windows.

| # | Status | Category | Item | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | ⬜ | Debt | **`any` types in campaign activate/pause handlers** | `campaigns.ts:256,288` | Type `request` and `reply` properly using Fastify generics. |
| P3-2 | ⬜ | Debt | **428 ESLint warnings in dashboard** | Dashboard-wide | Resolve incrementally: prioritize `no-explicit-any` and `rules-of-hooks` first. |
| P3-3 | ⬜ | Security | **R2 bucket on rate-limited r2.dev URL** — The snippet CDN and WP plugin download use the `pub-*.r2.dev` URL. Rate-limited and not recommended for production by Cloudflare. | `Sites.tsx:195` | Connect `cdn.scrollpop.online` as a custom domain on the `scrollpop-assets` R2 bucket. Update both URLs. |
| P3-4 | ⬜ | Security | **No session revocation mechanism** — Relies entirely on Clerk JWT TTL. A compromised token remains valid until it expires. | `tenant-context.ts` | For high-value operations (plan change, delete tenant), add a `last_sign_out_at` check or call Clerk's session revocation API. |
| P3-5 | ⬜ | Feature | **`scrollpop.online` marketing site** — No separate marketing site exists. Operators cannot find ScrollPop without a direct link. | ✅ Promolayer has full site | Separate Cloudflare Pages project. Exists as `site-plan/` in repo — needs deploying and content. |
| P3-6 | ⬜ | Infra | **Render Pre-Deploy Command already set** — Migration drift prevention is in place. Document in runbook what to do if it fails. | MASTER.md §27 | Add a "Pre-deploy command failed" runbook entry: manual migration steps, rollback procedure. |
| P3-7 | ⬜ | Scale | **`resolveCampaignMeta` cache is instance-local** — On 2+ Render instances, each has a cold cache. DB queries spike per instance on cold start. | `index.ts:408` | Move campaign meta cache to a Redis hash: `HGETALL sp_campaign_meta:{campaignId}` with 5-minute TTL. |
| P3-8 | ⬜ | Scale | **Admin Clerk sync not paginated** — At >500 Clerk users, stale users past the limit won't be cleaned up. | `admin.ts:178` | Paginate with Clerk's cursor until response is empty. |
| P3-9 | ⬜ | Feature | **Coupon validation on `/e` ingest** — `discount_redeemed` event type exists but there is no server-side validation that a coupon code is valid before accepting the event. | `index.ts` | Look up coupon against `coupons` table on `discount_redeemed` event type. Mark redeemed. |
| P3-10 | ⬜ | Feature | **Mobile-specific trigger overrides** — Promolayer calls out explicit mobile trigger customization. ScrollPop handles device targeting but has no per-device trigger param overrides. | Promolayer marketing | Allow different scroll % or dwell time thresholds for mobile vs desktop in the trigger config. |
| P3-11 | ⬜ | Debt | **`ensure-notifications.ts` and `ensure-partitions.ts` run a DB call on every cold start** — Adds latency to every new Render instance spin-up. | `index.ts:560,563` | Move to a startup probe that only runs the check once per deploy (cache a flag in Redis). Or convert to a proper migration. |
| P3-12 | ⬜ | Debt | **Conversion milestone Redis counter starts at zero from feature launch** — Historical conversions are not counted. Users who have existing conversions see a misleadingly low milestone count. | `index.ts:351` | On first `incr` (result = 1), backfill the counter from the DB `count(*)` of historical `conversion` events for that tenant, then continue incrementing. |

---

## Won't Build

Deliberately excluded. Do not add to any sprint.

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Back-button capture | Google spam policy violation from Jun 15, 2026. Would cause de-indexing of customer sites. |
| SAML SSO | No enterprise customers. V3 at earliest. |
| Native iOS/Android SDKs | No demand signal. |
| ClickHouse migration | Only justified at >50M events/month. |
| Real-time social proof popups | Requires pub/sub infra. Complexity not justified now. |
| AI copy generation | Nice-to-have. Not a conversion driver at this stage. |
| Wix native app | Low ROI. Wix has tiny market share vs Shopify/WordPress. |
| Full white-labelling | V3. No enterprise customers. |

---

## Dependency Map

Some items must be completed in order.

## Sprint Suggestions

Based on severity and dependency order.

### Sprint 1 — Revenue Gate (do this first)
P0-1, P0-2, P0-5, P1-4, P1-5

Fix the rawBody bug, configure Stripe, bust KV on activate/pause, fix the worst performance issue. Goal: billing works end-to-end.

### Sprint 2 — Core Product Parity
P0-3, P0-4, P1-7, P1-8, P1-9, P1-11

Lead storage + UI, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, countdown timers. Goal: email capture actually does something useful.

### Sprint 3 — Shopify Growth

App Embed Block, App Store submission, thundering herd fix, ReDoS fix, onboarding. Goal: inbound discovery from Shopify App Store.

### Sprint 4 — Security & Stability Hardening
P1-1, P1-2, P1-3, P2-1 through P2-6, P2-7, P2-8, P2-9

Cross-tenant injection, open redirect, quota abuse, CSP, audit log, analytics indexes, admin N+1, purge job externalization.

### Sprint 5 — Feature Completeness
P1-10, P1-12, P2-12, P2-13, P2-14, P2-17

Real A/B testing, gamified popups, coupons, auto-responders, Zapier/webhook outbound, team invitations.

### Ongoing / Maintenance
P2-15 through P2-19, all P3 items — address during low-intensity periods between sprints.
